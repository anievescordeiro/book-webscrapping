## Let's scrape books!ðŸ“š

If you still don't have an idea of what it is **Web scrapping** it's as easy as extracting structured data from a web page.

In this notebook you'll find a tour on scrapping a ficticious book webpage (http://books.toscrape.com) mainly using two Python libraries: **Beautiful Soup** ðŸ¥˜ for pulling data out of HTML and XML files and **Requests** library for making HTTP requests in Python.

After the tutorial notebook on Webscrapping, you'll see an additional data visualization of the info collected from the site using the amazing visualization tools from Python such as: Matplotlib, Pandas and Seaborn libraries.
